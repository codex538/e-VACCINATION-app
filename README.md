# e-Vaccination android app

I am Karan Sankhavara, and my friends and I completed this project. My role was mostly handling back-end errors and development.

Purpose:

Schedule appointments at nearby vaccination centers.

Maintain digital records of administered vaccines for individuals.
Provide vaccination certificates for personal and official use.
• Facilitating Data Analysis :
Support governments and health organizations with data for decision-making.
Monitor vaccine efficacy and manage inventory efficiently.
• Improving Accessibility :
Provide reminders for upcoming doses.
